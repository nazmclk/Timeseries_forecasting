# ⏳ Time Series Forecasting<br>
📊 Predicting future trends using time series analysis,a comprehensive time series forecasting projects leveraging statistical and deep learning models for predictive analytics.<br>


## 📖 Project Description<br>
The aim of this project is to familiarize yourself with Timeseries data, gain familiarity with analysis and forecasting methods, and provide information about real-world use cases.This project focuses on time series forecasting, leveraging statistical and machine-deep learning models to predict future values based on historical data. It includes data preprocessing (may differ for each model), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to achieve high accuracy.<br>

## 🚀 Technologies Used<br>
✔ Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Statsmodels)<br>
✔ Time Series Models (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, GRU, DeepAR(by AWS).... )<br>
✔ Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)<br>
